- Machine learning : is a comprehensive approach to solving problems…
- Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it’s not explicitly programmed to identify.
- A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
- Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
- In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won’t know which one will perform best for your dataset.
- The two most common categories of tasks are :

   - Supervised Learning : includes tasks for “labeled” data (i.e. you have a target variable).

        In practice, it’s often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.

        Each observation must be labeled with a “correct answer.”

        Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what’s “correct” while training it (hence, “supervising” it).

        Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.

        Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. “class”) target variables.
    - Unsupervised Learning : includes tasks for “unlabeled” data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

        In practice, it’s often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.

        Unlabeled data has no predetermined “correct answer.”

        You’ll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without “supervision”).

        Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it’s for finding groups within your data.

- Three elements of great machine learning

    A skilled chef (Human guidance) - First, even though we are “teaching computers to learn on their own,” human guidance plays a huge role.

    Fresh ingredients (Clean relative data) - The second essential element is the quality of your data.

    Don’t overcook it (Avoid overfitting) - An overfit model has “memorized” the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.
## How does supervised machine learning work?
Supervised machine learning requires the data scientist to train the algorithm with both labeled inputs and desired outputs. Supervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks:

1. **Binary classification**: Dividing data into two categories.
2. **Multi-class classification**: Choosing between more than two types of answers.
3. **Regression modeling**: Predicting continuous values.
4. **Ensembling**: Combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models to produce an accurate prediction.

## How does unsupervised machine learning work?

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require data to be labeled. They sift through unlabeled data to look for patterns that can be used to group data points into subsets. Most types of deep learning, including neural networks, are unsupervised algorithms. Unsupervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks:


* Clustering: Splitting the dataset into groups based on similarity.
* Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual data points in a data set.
* Association mining: Identifying sets of items in a data set that frequently occur together.
* Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of variables in a data set.
