# Assets, Metadata, and CSS

## Assets

Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets.

### Download Your Profile Picture

First, let's retrieve your profile picture.

* Download your profile picture in .jpg format (or use this file).
* Create an images directory inside of the public directory.
Save the picture as profile.jpg in the public/images directory.
* The image size can be around 400px by 400px.
* You may remove the unused SVG logo file directly under the public directory.

### Unoptimized Image

With regular HTML, you would add your profile picture as follows:

```
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Your Name" />

```
However, this means you have to manually handle:

1. Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes
2. Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library
3. Only loading images when they enter the viewport

And more. Instead, Next.js provides an Image component out of the box to handle this for you.

### Image Component and Image Optimization

Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it. This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.

Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.

### Using the Image Component

Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.

Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.

Images are always rendered in such a way as to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift, a Core Web Vital that Google is going to use in search ranking.

Here's an example using next/image to display our profile picture. The height and width props should be the desired rendering size, with an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
```

## Metadata

What if we wanted to modify the metadata of the page, such as the < title> HTML tag?

< title > is part of the < head> HTML tag, so let's dive into how we can modify the < head> tag in a Next.js page.

Open pages/index.js in your editor and find the following lines:

```
<Head>
  <title>Create Next App</title>
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
```
Notice that < Head > is used instead of the lowercase < head>. < Head> is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the < head> of a page.

You can import the Head component from the next/head module.

Adding Head to first-post.js
We haven't added a <title> to our /posts/first-post route. Let's add one.

Open the pages/posts/first-post.js file and add an import for Head from next/head at the beginning of the file:

```
import Head from 'next/head'
```

Then, update the exported FirstPost component to include the Head component. For now, we‘ll add just the title tag:

```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```
Try accessing http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post. The browser tab should now say “First Post”. By using your browser’s developer tools, you should see that the title tag is added to < head>.

## CSS Styling

Let’s now talk about CSS styling.

As you can see, our index page (http://localhost:3000) already has some styles. If you take a look at pages/index.js, you should see code like this:

```
<style jsx>{`
  …
`}</style>
```
This page is using a library called styled-jsx. It’s a “CSS-in-JS” library — it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be scoped (other components won’t be affected).

Next.js has built-in support for styled-jsx, but you can also use other popular CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled-components or emotion.
