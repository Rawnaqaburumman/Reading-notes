### React:
* is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.

### React Features :
1. JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended. 
2. Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.
3. Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.
4. License

### React Advantages:
* Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
* Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
* Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.

### React Limitations:
1. Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.
2. Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.

* **JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension** : JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. This makes the code easier to understand and debug, as it avoids the usage of complex JavaScript DOM structures.
* **Virtual Document Object Model**: Virtual Document Object Model
 
React creates an in-memory data structure cache which computes the changes made and then updates the browser. This allows a special feature that enables the programmer to code as if the whole page is rendered on each change whereas react library only renders components that actually change.

## What is Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. In contrast to other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS it doesn’t come with predefined components. Instead Tailwind CSS operates on a lower level and provides you with a set of CSS helper classes. By using this classes you can rapidly create custom design with ease. Tailwind CSS is not opinionated and let’s you create you own unique design.
