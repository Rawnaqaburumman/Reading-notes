# Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Nearly every website nowadays seems to greet you with a Chatbot. They range from simple programs with limited conversational capabilities, to intelligent, conversationally capable bots thanks to advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning.
# What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

# What does a GET do?

 GET is usually intended to retrieve some data, and is expected to be idempotent (repeating the query does not have any side-effects)

# What does a Post do?
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST is one of the most common HTTP methods. Some other notes on POST requests: POST requests are never cached.
# What does PATCH do?

The patch releases a daily dose of hormones through the skin into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It contains the same hormones as the combined pill – oestrogen and progestogen – and works in the same way by preventing the release of an egg each month (ovulation).
