# Configuring Django Settings

Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, some mocked data, etc). You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. 
## Setting Configuration: Different Approaches
There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best. Let’s take a brief look at the most popular ones to examine their weaknesses and strengths.

## settings_local.py

This is the oldest method. I used it when I was configuring a Django project on a production server for the first time. I saw a lot of people use it back in the day, and I still see it now.

The basic idea of this method is to extend all environment-specific settings in the settings_local.py file, which is ignored by VCS.

# How Does SSH Work
## What is SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.


## How Does SSH Work

If you’re using Linux or Mac, then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client to open SSH connections. The most popular SSH client is PuTTY, which you can learn more about here.

For Mac and Linux users, head over to your terminal program and then follow the procedure below:



```
ssh {user}@{host}
```


## Understanding Different Encryption Techniques

The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client. Host refers to the remote server you are trying to access, while the client is the computer you are using to access the host. There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:

1. Symmetrical encryption
2. Asymmetrical encryption
3. Hashing.
