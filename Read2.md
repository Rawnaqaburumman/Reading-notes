### Revisions and the Cloud
## Version Control
 a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes,can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes
 
 ## Local Version Control
 A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files
 
 ## Centralized Version Control
 This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
 
 ## Distributed Version Control
 allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
 
 ### Git :
 A DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
