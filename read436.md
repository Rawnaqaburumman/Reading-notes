## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice
• The Advice: Communicate!
• First, Restate the Question

 understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar,
 but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past
 
 • Ask About Edge Cases:
 
 It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.
In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great — it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).

• Ask About Test Cases

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

• Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

• Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

• Stuck? Ask for Help!

example:
“I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
