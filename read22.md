- As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.



- Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. ‘‘And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,’’ Rozovsky said. ‘‘I’d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.’’ Rozovsky’s study group at Yale was draining because the norms — the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique — put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team — enthusiasm for one another’s ideas, joking around and having fun — allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.


### What are the characteristics of a successful team?
Successful teams encourage team members to share ideas, consider solutions and solve problems together. Good teams benefit individual members by offering added support and opportunities for development.  Successful teams typically have the following characteristics:

- Goal-oriented mindset: The most effective teams set, implement and track goals together to increase efficiency and improve productivity. 

- Commitment to their roles: Individuals working in roles based on their strengths and expertise are often highly motivated.

- Open to learning: Some teams may adjust roles and responsibilities due to the needs of a project or task. Team members who are interested in challenging their skills and learning to complete new individual tasks encourage professional growth.

- Diverse perspectives and experiences: Since diversity tends to encourage creativity and innovation, teams with the largest spectrum of experiences and opinions have the potential to perform at their best.

- Shared culture: Whether it is a company culture or group culture, teams who are united by a singular mission or set of values are often more motivated.

- Responsibility and accountability: When teams share a set of values and goals, each team member can be held to the same standard. 

- Clear communication: Good teams brainstorm solutions, provide status updates and complete tasks.

- An effective leader: Leaders who provide clear direction and encourage team members to succeed are typically managing successful teams.
