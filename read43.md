# What Is a File?
- a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data.
-  This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable
-  Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
 1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
 2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
 3.End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
 
 # File Paths:
 When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file.
 
 # Exceptions versus Syntax Errors:
 - Syntax errors
- The AssertionError Exception
- The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions

# Raising:
- We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.
