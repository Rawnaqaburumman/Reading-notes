* **Regression analysis** is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them.
* **Regression** searches for relationships among variables.
* **Linear regression** is a basic and commonly used type of **predictive analysis**.The overall idea of regression is to examine two things:
 1. does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?
 2. Which variables in particular are ignificant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude
 sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable? 
 * These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one **dependent variable** and one or more **independent variables**.
* Dependent variables -> outputs-> responses.


## Assumptions of a Linear Regression

Statistics Solutions can assist with your quantitative analysis by assisting you to develop your methodology and results chapters. The services that we offer include:

## Data Analysis Plan

- Edit your research questions and null/alternative hypotheses

- Write your data analysis plan; specify specific statistics to address the research questions, the assumptions of the statistics, and justify why they are the appropriate statistics; provide references

- Justify your sample size/power analysis, provide references

- Explain your data analysis plan to you so you are comfortable and confident

- Two hours of additional support with your statistician

## Quantitative Results Section (Descriptive Statistics, Bivariate and Multivariate Analyses, Structural Equation Modeling, Path analysis, HLM, Cluster Analysis)

- Clean and code dataset

- Conduct descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, frequency and percent, as appropriate)

- Conduct analyses to examine each of your research questions

- Write-up results

- Provide APA 6th edition tables and figures

- Explain chapter 4 findings

- Ongoing support for entire results chapter statistics
