# IMAGES:

Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.


####  Controlling sizes of images in CSS:

``` img.large {
width: 500px;
height: 500px;}
img.medium {
width: 250px;
height: 250px;}
img.small {
width: 100px;
height: 100px;}
``` 
#### AligNing images using CSS :
```  img.align-left {
float: left;
margin-right: 10px;}
img.align-right {
float: right;
margin-left: 10px;}
img.medium {
width: 250px;
height: 250px;}
``` 

##### background-image: The background-image
property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.


```  body {
background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");} 
``` 

##### Repeating Images: background-repeat background-attachment:
**repeat:**
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
