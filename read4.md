# JavaScript?
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation
## Dealing with JavaScript :
* Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new file called main.js, and save it.
* In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing `</body> tag`.
`<script src="scripts/main.js"></script>`
 ## Language basics:
 ### Variables: 
 Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the `var`,variables may hold values that have different **data types**:

 ### Comments:
 Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.
 `/*
Everything in between is a comment.
*/`
**or**
`// This is a comment`
### Operators:
An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables) such as :(Addition-Subtraction, Multiplication, Division-Assignment-Equality-Not, Does-not-equal).
### Conditionals:
Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement.
### Functions:
Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.
`alert('hello!');`
### Arrays :
Arrays are lists of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type. Arrays are created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets [].
`// An array containing numbers
const numberArray = [0, 1, 2, 3];`
