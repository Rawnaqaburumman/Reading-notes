#### Programming is easy if you understand the problem domainز
What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

- Make the problem domain easier
- Get better at understanding the problem domain

You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

What I mean by this is that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.

Games are really good at this.  Look at most games today and you’ll find that you start with a very small problem domain.  The first level is usually a tutorial that has a basic set of things you can do so that you don’t get overwhelmed.  But, as you advance through the levels, you usually find they get harder and introduce new concepts that build gradually on what you know, until you understand a pretty large problem domain.


## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

**VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES**
**FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS**
This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method. The object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable called hotel .Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object, that name is called a key .

Objects stored in a variable called hotel1.using dot notation we can acess to proprites and of an object.


The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTMLpage and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

**THE DOCUMENT NODE**
Above, you can see the HTML code for a shopping list, and on the right hand page is its DOM tree.Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOM node. At the top of the tree a document node is added; it represents the entire page (and also corresponds to the document object, which you first met on p36). When you access any element, attribute, or text node, you navigate to it via the document node. It is
the starting point for all visits to the DOM tree.

**ELEMENT NODES**

HTML elements describe the structure of an HTML page. (The <h l > - <h6> elements describe what parts are headings; the <p> tags indicate where paragraphs of text start and finish; and so on.)
