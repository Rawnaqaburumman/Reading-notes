# What does REST stand for?
REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
# REST APIs are designed around a ?
A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data.
# What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
A URI — short for “Uniform Resource Identifier” — is a sequence of characters that distinguishes one resource from another. For example, foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose is a URI containing a scheme name, authority, path, query and fragment. A URI does not need to contain all these components.
# What are the most common HTTP verbs?
The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently.

# What should the URIs be based on?
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies.

# What status code does a successful POST request return?
if a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.

If the method does some processing but does not create a new resource, the method can return HTTP status code 200 and include the result of the operation in the response body. Alternatively, if there is no result to return, the method can return HTTP status code 204 (No Content) with no response body.

If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request). The response body can contain additional information about the error or a link to a URI that provides more details.

# What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
