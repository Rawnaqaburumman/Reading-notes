# What types of things can you pass in the props?
we used props when we want to pass information between compnents,arrtibute that we are extending from the react library.

# What is the big difference between props and state?
The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
When do we re-render our application?
to build the structure of webpages.
# What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
data like variables,codes,....


##### What are component lifecycle events?
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

#### Converting a Function to a Class
-You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

- Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
- Add a single empty method to it called render().
- Move the body of the function into the render() method.
- Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
- Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
- class Clock extends React.Component {


 ######  Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
```
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```
