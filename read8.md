When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special computer known as a **Web Server** which hosts the website.

### How to write web pages and Structure the document ?
HTML Describes the Structure of Pages, To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page between elements, inside angled brackets 
every element tells the browser something about the information in it.


``` <html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html> 
```

## HTML5 Layout: 
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
