   # **GIT :** 
   ## What is get ?
   **Get is a Distributed Version Control systems that stores data in a file system made up of `snapshots`.Each time you save a changed version of your project Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.**

   **Git mostly relies on `local operations` allows for process expediency and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.get can also `track changing` and detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.
   Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files so it `keep data` from losing, files in Git can reside in three main `states`: committed, modified and staged.**
   
   
**It is worth noting that Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel  Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design.**

### Configuration of Variables
## Git commands : 
**{git add . }: used to add change to the file .**

**{git commit -m } : to write your change in file and why.**

**{git push origin main} : to push changes from get to files.**

**{get status } : tell me the status .**


# Local Repository Structure

## The local Git repository has three components:

**Working Directory : The actual files reside here.**

**Index: The area used for staging**

**Head: Points to the most recent commit**
