What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state. In a controlled component, the form element's data is handled by the React component (not DOM) and kept in the component's state.

Why would we use a ternary operator?
The ternary operator greatly increases the conciseness of your code. When it is formatted correctly it can also be very easy to read and, dare I say it, even easier then if-else statements.

There seems to be some controversy over when to use the Ternary Operator and when to use If-Else statements. Some will say that the Ternary Operator should only be used for simple variable assignments, like shown in example 1. Some say that if the ternary operator get’s to complex (nested) then it is far better to use an if else statement. I beg to differ – with good formatting, the ternary operator beats the if-else statement every time.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement
x===y? console.log(true): console.log(fulse)
