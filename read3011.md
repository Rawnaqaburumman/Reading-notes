# Component Based Architecture

- ### What is a component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

- ### What are the charactistics of a component?

1- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

2- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

3- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

4- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

5- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

6- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
 


 - ### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
* ase of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

* Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

* Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

* Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- ### What is props short for?

Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.


- ### How are props used in React?
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data
