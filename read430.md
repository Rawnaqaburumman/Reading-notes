# Hashtables

## What is a Hashtable?

### Terminology:

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Why do we use them?

- Hold unique values

- Dictionary

- Library

### What Are they

- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.





#### Hash maps do this to store values:
- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list
- Hash maps do this to read value:
- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
- search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

 
### Internal Methods
- Add()

    - When adding a new key/value pair to a hash table:
    - send the key to the GetHash method.
    - Once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go to that index
    - Check if something exists at that index already, if it doesnâ€™t, add it with the key/value pair.
    - If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.
- Find()
    - The Find takes in a key, gets the Hash, and goes to the index location specified. Once at the index - - - location is found in the array, it is then the responsibility of the algorithm the iterate through the - bucket and see if the key exists and return the value.
- Contains()
    - The Contains method will accept a key, and return a bool on if that key exists inside the hash table. - - The best way to do this is to have the contains call the GetHash and check the hash table if the key - - exists in the table given the index returned.
- GetHash()
    - The GetHash will accept a key as a string, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array - - - where the key/value should be placed.
