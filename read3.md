# wireframing
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product, Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
Wireframing can be drawn by :

1- hand on paper

2- softwar such as : [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/),[Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/) etc

### Six steps to make your wireframe:

-  Add some detail and get testing
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
